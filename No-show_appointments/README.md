# Project: No-show appointments Analysis

We are going to analyze the dataset "No-show appointments". 
It is a dataset of medical appointments in Brazil, where the the question is if a patient show up for their appointments or not. 

We are going to look for any relation between no show up to their appointments and others variables. [See Project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josemaria500/Data_Analysis/blob/main/No-show_appointments/No-show_appointments.html)
