# Gather data and analyze

In this project we are going to take 3 differents sources of data:

| File | 
| ------ | 
| twiteer-archive-enhanced.csv |
| image-predictions.tsv | 
| tweet-json | 


and try to search for example which is the most common dog that appears in the tweets, most common word and most common numerator rating. [See Project](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josemaria500/Data_Analysis/blob/main/Gather_data_and_analyze/Gather_data_and_analyze.html)
